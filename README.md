### Introduction
In this section, you'll create a live updating progress bar for the video player.
The progress shown should the duration of content watched in relation to the video duration.
The progress bar should be able to handle the video loop (ie once the video restarts, you
should be able to start the progress bar over again.). 

You should optimize for web performance during this exercise. You do not need to handle any 
edge cases, such as the player being paused, or a seek happening.

You may not use any external packages. You must rely on native browser animation functionality,
and React's built in tools.
